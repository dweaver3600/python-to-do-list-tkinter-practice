# python-to-do-list-tkinter-practice
A practice project using tkinter to make a simple GUI.

Add items to the list by typing in the Entry box and use enter or the button to commit the item to the list.

The GUI  will highlight any entries that would be duplicates.

Remove items from the list by clicking on the added text.
